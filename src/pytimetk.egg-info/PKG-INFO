# Introducing pytimetk: Simplifying Time Series Analysis for Everyone

Time series analysis is fundamental in many fields, from business forecasting to scientific research. While the Python ecosystem offers tools like `pandas`, they sometimes can be verbose and not optimized for all operations, especially for complex time-based aggregations and visualizations.

Enter **pytimetk**. Crafted with a blend of ease-of-use and computational efficiency, `pytimetk` significantly simplifies the process of time series manipulation and visualization. By leveraging the `polars` backend, you can experience speed improvements ranging from 3X to a whopping 3500X. Let's dive into a comparative analysis.

| Features/Properties | **pytimetk**                  | **pandas (+matplotlib)**               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Speed**           | 🚀 3X to 3500X Faster          | 🐢 Standard                           |
| **Code Simplicity** | 🎉 Concise, readable syntax    | 📜 Often verbose                      |
| `plot_timeseries()` | 🎨 2 lines, no customization  | 🎨 16 lines, customization needed    |
| `summarize_by_time()` | 🕐 2 lines, 13.4X faster     | 🕐 6 lines, 2 for-loops               |
| `pad_by_time()`     | ⛳ 2 lines, fills gaps in timeseries        | ❌ No equivalent    |
| `anomalize()`       | 📈 2 lines, detects and corrects anomalies  | ❌ No equivalent    |
| `augment_timeseries_signature()` | 📅 1 line, all calendar features    | 🕐 29 lines of `dt` extractors |
| `augment_rolling()` | 🏎️ 10X to 3500X faster     | 🐢 Slow Rolling Operations |

As evident from the table, **pytimetk** is not just about speed; it also simplifies your codebase. For example, `summarize_by_time()`, converts a 6-line, double for-loop routine in `pandas` into a concise 2-line operation. And with the `polars` engine, get results 13.4X faster than `pandas`!
  
Similarly, `plot_timeseries()` dramatically streamlines the plotting process, encapsulating what would typically require 16 lines of `matplotlib` code into a mere 2-line command in **pytimetk**, without sacrificing customization or quality. And with `plotly` and `plotnine` engines, you can create interactive plots and beautiful static visualizations with just a few lines of code.

For calendar features, **pytimetk** offers `augment_timeseries_signature()` which cuts down on over 30 lines of `pandas` dt extractions. For rolling features, **pytimetk** offers `augment_rolling()`, which is 10X to 3500X faster than `pandas`. It also offers `pad_by_time()` to fill gaps in your time series data, and `anomalize()` to detect and correct anomalies in your time series data.

Join the revolution in time series analysis. Reduce your code complexity, increase your productivity, and harness the speed that **pytimetk** brings to your workflows.

# Installation

Install the latest stable version of `pytimetk` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pytimetk
```

Alternatively you can install the development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/business-science/pytimetk.git
```

# Quickstart:

This is a simple code to test the function `summarize_by_time`:

```python
import pytimetk as tk
import pandas as pd

df = tk.datasets.load_dataset('bike_sales_sample')
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])

df \
    .groupby("category_2") \
    .summarize_by_time(
        date_column='order_date', 
        value_column= 'total_price',
        freq = "MS",
        agg_func = ['mean', 'sum'],
        engine = "polars"
    )
```
