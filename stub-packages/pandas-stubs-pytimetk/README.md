# pandas-stubs-pytimetk

Type stubs that extend pandas with the accessor methods exposed by
[pytimetk](https://business-science.github.io/pytimetk/).

These stubs are consumed by static analysis tools such as VS Code’s Pylance
so that pytimetk dataframe and groupby helpers appear in completions and
hover tooltips without any additional configuration.

The files in this package are generated from the pytimetk source via
`python scripts/generate_pandas_stubs.py`.  See the main project’s
documentation for the full workflow.
