# Introducing pytimetk: Simplifying Time Series Analysis for Everyone

Time series analysis is fundamental in many fields, from business forecasting to scientific research. While the Python ecosystem offers tools like `pandas`, they sometimes can be verbose and not optimized for all operations, especially for complex time-based aggregations and visualizations.

Enter **pytimetk**. Crafted with a blend of ease-of-use and computational efficiency, `pytimetk` significantly simplifies the process of time series manipulation and visualization. By leveraging the `polars` backend, you can experience speed improvements ranging from 3X to a whopping 3500X. Let's dive into a comparative analysis.


| Features/Properties | **pytimetk**                  | **pandas (+matplotlib)**               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Speed**           | 🚀 3X to 500X Faster          | 🐢 Standard                           |
| **Code Simplicity** | 🎉 Concise, readable syntax    | 📜 Often verbose                      |
| `plot_timeseries()` | 🎨 2 lines, no customization  | 🎨 16 lines, customization needed    |
| `summarize_by_time()` | 🕐 2 lines, 13.4X faster     | 🕐 6 lines, 2 for-loops               |
| `pad_by_time()`     | ⛳ 2 lines, fills gaps in timeseries        | ❌ No equivalent    |
| `anomalize()`       | 📈 2 lines, detects and corrects anomalies  | ❌ No equivalent    |
| `augment_timeseries_signature()` | 📅 1 line, all calendar features    | 🕐 30 lines of `dt` extractors |
| `augment_rolling()` | 🏎️ 10X to 3500X faster     | 🐢 Slow Rolling Operations |

As evident from the table, **pytimetk** is not just about speed; it also simplifies your codebase. For example, `summarize_by_time()`, converts a 6-line, double for-loop routine in `pandas` into a concise 2-line operation. And with the `polars` engine, get results 13.4X faster than `pandas`!
  
Similarly, `plot_timeseries()` dramatically streamlines the plotting process, encapsulating what would typically require 16 lines of `matplotlib` code into a mere 2-line command in **pytimetk**, without sacrificing customization or quality. And with `plotly` and `plotnine` engines, you can create interactive plots and beautiful static visualizations with just a few lines of code.

For calendar features, **pytimetk** offers `augment_timeseries_signature()` which cuts down on over 30 lines of `pandas` dt extractions. For rolling features, **pytimetk** offers `augment_rolling()`, which is 10X to 3500X faster than `pandas`. It also offers `pad_by_time()` to fill gaps in your time series data, and `anomalize()` to detect and correct anomalies in your time series data.

Join the revolution in time series analysis. Reduce your code complexity, increase your productivity, and harness the speed that **pytimetk** brings to your workflows.

# 🚀 Installation

Install the Latest Stable Version:

``` bash
pip install pytimetk
```

Alternatively, install the Development GitHub Version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/business-science/pytimetk.git
```

# 🏁 Quick Start: A Monthly Sales Analysis

This is a simple exercise to showcase the power of [`summarize_by_time()`](/reference/summarize_by_time.html):

### Import Libraries & Data

First, `import pytimetk as tk`. This gets you access to the most important functions. Use `tk.load_dataset()` to load the "bike_sales_sample" dataset.

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## About the Bike Sales Sample Dataset

This dataset contains "orderlines" for orders recieved. The `order_date` column contains timestamps. We can use this column to peform sales aggregations (e.g. total revenue).
:::

```{python}
import pytimetk as tk
import pandas as pd

df = tk.load_dataset('bike_sales_sample')
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])

df   
```

### Using `summarize_by_time()` for a Sales Analysis

Your company might be interested in sales patterns for various categories of bicycles. We can obtain a grouped monthly sales aggregation by `category_1` in two lines of code:

1. First use pandas's `groupby()` method to group the DataFrame on `category_1`
2. Next, use timetk's `summarize_by_time()` method to apply the sum function my month start ("MS") and use `wide_format = 'False'` to return the dataframe in a long format (Note long format is the default). The default engine is `"pandas"`. Selecting `engine = "polars"` allows us to improve the speed of the function. 

The result is the total revenue for Mountain and Road bikes by month. 

```{python}
summary_category_1_df = df \
    .groupby("category_1") \
    .summarize_by_time(
        date_column  = 'order_date', 
        value_column = 'total_price',
        freq         = "MS",
        agg_func     = 'sum',
        wide_format  = False,
        engine       = "polars"
    )

# Quickly examine each column
summary_category_1_df.glimpse()
```



### Visualizing Sales Patterns

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Now available: `plot_timeseries()`.

Plot time series is a quick and easy way to visualize time series and make professional time series plots. 
:::

With the data summarized by time, we can visualize with `plot_timeseries()`. `pytimetk` functions are `groupby()` aware meaning they understand if your data is grouped to do things by group. This is useful in time series where we often deal with 100s of time series groups. 

The default engine in "plotnine" for static plotting. Setting the `engine = "plotly"` returns an interactive plot. 

```{python}
summary_category_1_df \
    .groupby('category_1') \
    .plot_timeseries(
        date_column  = 'order_date',
        value_column = 'total_price_sum',
        smooth_frac  = 0.8,
        engine       = "plotly"
    )
```
