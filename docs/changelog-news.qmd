# pytimetk 1.0.1.9000

## New Features

### Time Series Cross Validation (TSCV)

Integration with `timebasedcv` #291. New Classes:

- `TimeSeriesCV()`: An enhanced version of `TimeBasedSplit()` that defaults to `mode = "backwards"`, allows for maximum splits using `split_limit`, and adds enhanced diagnostics like `glimpse()` and `plot()`

### Plotly Dropdowns

A plotly dropdown automates the group-wise analysis. Instead of facets, which are only powerful for <=9 plots at a time, a dropdown can easily visualize more plots. 

- `plot_timeseries()`: Gets new parameters `plotly_dropdown`, `plotly_dropdown_x`, `plotly_dropdown_y` #301
- `plot_anomalies()`: Gets new parameters `plotly_dropdown`, `plotly_dropdown_x`, `plotly_dropdown_y` #301

### Wide-Format Plotting

- plot_timeseries(value_column = list(), color_column=list()): Now supports multiple columns in wide format for grouped time series data visualization. #136


# pytimetk 1.0.1

## Fixes:

- `tk.summarize_by_time()`: AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'groupby' #298

# pytimetk 1.0.0 

## Pandas and Polars Compatibility:

Upgrading to:

- pandas >= 2.0.0
- polars >= 1.2.0

Use pytimetk <=0.4.0 to support:

- pandas <2.0.0
- polars <1.0.0

## Improvements:

- Implement `sort_dataframe()`: This function is used internally to make sure Polars and Pandas engines perform grouped operations consistently and correctly. #286 #290
- `.augment_lags()` and `.augment_leads()`: value_column now accepts any dtype. #295

# pytimetk 0.4.0

## Feature Engineering Module:

1. `augment_pct_change()`: pandas and polars engines

## Finance Module Updates:

1. `augment_macd()`: MACD, pandas and polars engines
2. `augment_bbands()`: Bollinger Bands, pandas and polars engines
3. `augment_atr()`: Average True Range, pandas and polars engines
4. `augment_ppo()`: Percentage Price Oscillator, pandas and polars engines
5. `augment_rsi()`: Relative Strength Index, pandas and polars engines
6. `augment_qsmomentum()`: Quant Science Momentum Indicator, pandas and polars engines
7. `augment_roc()`: Rate of Change (ROC), pandas and polars engines

## Polars Upgrades

- Migrate to `polars 0.20.7`

# pytimetk 0.3.0 

### Correlation Funnel

The R package `correlationfunnel` has been ported inside `pytimetk`:

- `binarize()`
- `correlate()`
- `plot_correlation_funnel()`

### Core:

- `filter_by_time()` - Filtering with time-based strings

### Feature Engineering:

- `augment_diffs()` - Can now add differenced columns
- `augment_fourier()` - Can now add fourier features. 

### Finance Module:

- `augment_cmo()`: Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)


### New Polars Backends:

- `augment_diffs()`
- `augment_fourier()` 
- `augment_cmo()` 

### General

- Make memory reduction optional #275

# pytimetk 0.2.1

Bugfix - Issue with `augment_rolling(engine='pandas')` and `augment_expanding(engine='pandas')` with concatinating rolled/expanded calc's to the correct group

# pytimetk 0.2.0

### Anomaly Detection

- `anomalize()`: A new scalable function for detecting time series anomalies (outliers) 
- `plot_anomalies()`: A scalable visualization tool for inspecting anomalies in time series data. 
- `plot_anomalies_decomp`: A scalable visualization tool for inspecting the observed, seasonal, trend, and remainder decomposition, which are useful for telling you whether or not anomalies are being detected to your preference.
- `plot_anomalies_cleaned()`: A scalable visualization tool for showing the before and after transformation for the cleaned vs uncleaned anomalies. 

### New Functions:

- `apply_by_time()`: For complex apply-style aggregations by time. 
- `augment_rolling_apply()`: For complex rolling operations using apply-style data frame functions.  
- `augment_expanding()`: For expanding calculations with single-column functions (e.g. mean). 
- `augment_expanding_apply()`: For complex expanding operations with apply-style data frame functions.
- `augment_hilbert()`: Hilbert features for signal processing.
- `augment_wavelet()`: Wavelet transform features. 
- `get_frequency()`: Infer a pandas-like frequency. More robust than `pandas.infer_freq`.
- `get_seasonal_frequency()`: Infer the pandas-like seasonal frequency (periodicity) for the time series. 
- `get_trend_frequency()`: Infer the pandas-like trend for the time series. 

### New Finance Module

More coming soon.

- `augment_ewm()`: Exponentially weighted augmentation

### Speed Improvements

#### Polars Engines:

- `summarize_by_time()`: Gains a polars engine. 
  - 3X to 10X speed improvements. 
- `augment_lags()` and `augment_leads()`: Gains a polars engine. Speed improvements increase with number of lags/leads. 
  - 6.5X speed improvement with 100 lags. 
- `augment_rolling()`: Gains a polars engine. 10X speed improvement.
- `augment_expanding()`: Gains a polars engine. 
- `augment_timeseries_signature()`: Gains a polars engine. 3X speed improvement.
- `augment_holiday_signature()`: Gains a polars engine.

#### Parallel Processing and Vectorized Optimizations:

- `pad_by_time()`: Complete overhaul. Uses Cartesian Product (Vectorization) to enhance the speed. 1000s of time series can now be padded in seconds.
  - **Independent review: Time went from over 90 minutes to 13 seconds for a 500X speedup on 10M rows.** 
- `future_frame()`: Complete overhaul. Uses vectorization when possible. Grouped parallel processing. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores. 
  - **Independent Review: Time went from 11 minutes to 2.5 minutes for a 4.4X speedup on 10M rows**
- `ts_features`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.
- `ts_summary`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.
- `anomalize`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.
- `augment_rolling()` and `augment_rolling_apply()`: Uses concurrent futures to parallelize tasks. Set `threads = -1` to use all cores.

### Helpful Utilities:

- `parallel_apply`: Mimics the `pandas apply()` function with concurrent futures.
- `progress_apply`: Adds a progress bar to pandas apply()
- `glimpse()`: Mimics tidyverse (tibble) glimpse function

### New Data Sets:

- `expedia`: Expedia hotel searches time series data set

### 3 New Applied Tutorials:

1. [Sales Analysis Tutorial](/tutorials/01_sales_crm.html)
2. [Finance Analysis Tutorial](/tutorials/02_finance.html)
3. [Demand Forecasting Tutorial](/tutorials/03_demand_forecasting.html)
4. [Anomaly Detection Tutorial](/tutorials/04_anomaly_detection.html)

### Final Deprecations:

- `summarize_by_time()`: `kind = "period"`. This was removed for consistency with `pytimetk`. "timestamp" is the default. 
- `augment_rolling()`: `use_independent_variables`. This is replaced by `augment_rolling_apply()`.
